Our Engineering Values describe what's important to us, things we value. They
guide us in our daily work and when decisions have to be made. To bring these
values to life we define more concrete Engineering Principles and apply them.
Nonetheless they should of course also be respected in any situation that is not
covered by the principles.

## Company over team over individual

We value decisions that have a positive impact for the entire tech organization
even if they have a negative impact on our own team. We rationally assess the
impact and acceptance of both new and current technologies on other teams. We
look for opportunities to help other teams benefit from what we are building.

## Security and reliability

The security of our products, tools, applications and users' data takes our
highest priority, followed by its reliability. We consider the criticality and
maturity of a product when deciding the level of effort required for resilience.
We react with urgency if problems are detected and we apply our security best
practices to all our applications.

## Moving fast

We optimize for speed of execution and learning over cost efficiency. We believe
it is important that teams contain the necessary people and power to build
features and products without a dependence on other teams. We use common
platforms and proven technologies to free product engineering teams from
building infrastructure as a prerequisite to creating value without compromising
quality.

## Outcome over effort

We celebrate the impact of our work over the effort we've been putting in or the
amount of code we produced. We understand the potential impact of our work to
our business and search for an easy, fast, secure way to validate our ideas
before writing any code. We accept when these goals cannot be achieved, are
comfortable moving on and learn from this experience. We reuse existing
solutions where possible in order to execute and scale the team quickly.

## Ease of people movement

The movement of people into teams with complex, high priority work is an
important part of how Scout24 will continue to grow as a business. To reduce
onboarding barriers, we value standardization of technologies and processes
across Scout24. We value engineers who can work across multiple stacks.

## Full ownership and clear responsibility

We believe teams are responsible for supporting, monitoring, alerting, operating
and retiring everything they build and maintain. Responsibilities and ownership
should always be clear and published. Everything must be owned.
